This project was created with vite. The goal here is to recap React most important features and overall practice. 

- hooks
- custom hooks
- state management
- component reusability
- and more...

If you want to fork and play around with the project:

- git clone the project
- npm install to install de the dependencies
- npm run dev  to start dev mode
- npm run build to make a production build

  Note: the starter files come from a Udemy course with Jonas Schmedtman about React.
  
To make the API calls work:

- Go to http://omdbapi.com/, and get yourself a API KEY. (It's free ‚úÖ).

- Create a .env file in the root of the project.

`
VITE_API_URL = 'http://omdbapi.com/'
`
<br>
`
VITE_API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
`

***Note***: Make sure the variable name starts with VITE_ , otherwise it won't work properly with Vite.
